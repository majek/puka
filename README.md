Puka - the opinionated RabbitMQ client
======================================

Puka is yet-another Python client library for RabbitMQ. But as opposed
to similar libraries, it does not try to expose a generic AMQP
API. Instead, it takes an opinionated view on how the user should
interact with RabbitMQ.


Puka is simple
--------------

Puka exposes a simple, easy to understand API. Take a look at the
`publisher` example:

    import puka

    client = puka.Client("amqp://localhost/")

    promise = client.connect()
    client.wait(promise)

    promise = client.queue_declare(queue='test')
    client.wait(promise)

    promise = client.basic_publish(exchange='', routing_key='test',
                                  body='Hello world!')
    client.wait(promise)


Puka is asynchronous
--------------------

Puka is fully asynchronous. Although, as you can see in example
above, it can behave synchronously. That's especially useful for
simple tasks when you don't want to introduce callbacks.

Here's the same code written in an asynchronous way:

    import puka

    def on_connection(promise, result):
        client.queue_declare(queue='test', callback=on_queue_declare)

    def on_queue_declare(promise, result):
        client.basic_publish(exchange='', routing_key='test',
                             body="Hello world!",
                             callback=on_basic_publish)

    def on_basic_publish(promise, result):
        print " [*] Message sent"
        client.loop_break()

    client = puka.Client("amqp://localhost/")
    client.connect(callback=on_connection)
    client.loop()

You can mix synchronous and asynchronous programming styles if you want
to.


Puka never blocks
-----------------

In the pure asynchronous programming style Puka never blocks your
program waiting for network. However it is your responsibility to
notify when new data is available on the network socket. To allow that
Puka allows you to access the raw socket descriptor. With that in hand
you can construct your own event loop. Here's an the event loop that
may replace `wait_for_any` from previous example:

     fd = client.fileno()
     while True:
        client.run_any_callbacks()

        r, w, e = select.select([fd],
                                [fd] if client.needs_write() else [],
                                [fd])
        if r or e:
            client.on_read()
        if w:
            client.on_write()


Puka is fast
------------

Puka is asynchronous and has no trouble in handling many requests at a
time. This can be exploited to achieve a degree of parallelism. For
example, this snippet creates 1000 queues in parallel:

    promises = [client.queue_declare(queue='a%04i' % i) for i in range(1000)]
    for promise in promises:
        client.wait(promise)

Puka also has a nicely optimized AMQP codec, but don't expect miracles
- it can't go faster than Python.

Puka is sane
------------

Puka does expose only a sane subset of AMQP, as judged by the author.

The major differences between Puka and normal AMQP libraries include:

  - Puka doesn't expose AMQP channels to the users.
  - Puka treats `basic_publish` as a synchronous method. You can wait
    on it and make sure that your data is delivered. Alternatively,
    you may ignore the promise and treat it as an asynchronous command.
  - Puka tries to cope with the AMQP exceptions and expose them
    to the user in a predictable way. Unlike other libraries it's
    possible (and recommended!) to recover from AMQP errors.


Puka is experimental
--------------------

Puka is a side project, written mostly to prove if it is possible to
create a reasonable API on top of the AMQP protocol.


I like it! Show me more!
------------------------

The best examples to start with are in the
[rabbitmq-tutorials repo](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-tutorials/tree/master/python-puka).

More code can be found in the `./examples` directory. Some
interesting bits:

  - `./examples/send.py`: sends one message
  - `./examples/receive_one.py`: receives one message
  - `./examples/stress_amqp_consume.py`: a script used to
    benchmark the throughput of the server


There is also a bunch of fairly complicated examples hidden in the
tests (see the `./tests` directory).


I want to install Puka
----------------------

Puka works with Python 2.6 and 2.7.

You can install Puka system-wide using pip:

    sudo pip install puka

Alternatively to install it in the `virtualenv` local environment:

     virtualenv my_venv
     pip -E my_venv install puka

Or if you need the code from trunk:

    sudo pip install -e git+http://github.com/majek/puka.git#egg=puka


I want to run the examples
--------------------------

Great. Make sure you have `rabbitmq` server installed and follow this
steps:

    git clone https://github.com/majek/puka.git
    cd puka
    make
    cd examples

Now you're ready to run the examples, start with:

    python send.py


I want to see the API documentation
-----------------------------------

The easiest way to get started is to take a look at the examples and
tweak them to your needs.  Detailed documentation doesn't exist
now. If it existed it would live here:
